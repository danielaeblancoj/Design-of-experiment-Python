    Main function to execute the program.
    Calls "user_input" function to receive the choice of the DOE user
    wants to build and to read the input CSV file with the ranges of the variables.
    Thereafter, it calls the "generate_DOE" function to generate the DOE matrix and a suitable
    filename corresponding to the user's DOE choice. Finally, it calls the "write_CSV" function
    to write the DOE matrix (a Pandas DataFrame object) into a CSV file on the disk, and prints
    a message indicating the filename.
